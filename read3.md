#Read: 03 - Structure web pages with HTML (Summary)


*Internet Service Provider (ISP), enable us to connect a web.*
*Domain Name System (DNS) server; that tells the browser the IP address associated with the requested domain name.*

How the web works?
1- When we type the domain name in the browser. ->
2- The computer contacts a DNS. ->
3- DNS server returns IP to computer allows the browser to contact the web server that hosts the Domain name. ->
4- The web server sends the web page that requested.
so, you be able to use the web page.

CH1- STRUCTURE:

-Web page structure is like any document, that uses headings and subheadings in its pages.
-So, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) has elements(character between angle brackets) to describe that.
- On the opening tag of the elements, what called Attribute may be there it provides additional information.
- Attribute made up of two parts: a name and a value.
-HTML is case-insensitive, but to follow writing convention is recommended.

Notepad and Notepad++ can be used to create a web page, just make the extension .html
_______
Some elements
- <body> -> Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
- <head> -> This contains information about the page (not shown inside).
- <title> ->" Either shown in the top of the browser, or on the tab for that page (on a browser uses tabs)."

CH 17- HTML5 Layout:

- HTML5 introduces a new set of elements, allow dividing up the parts of a page:
- <header>  <footer>: for dividing up appearance.
- <nav>: to contain the major navigational blocks.
- section>: groups related content together.
- <figure>: mostly used to contain Images and Videos, also for other types.

Ch 18 - Process & Design:
in website designing you should consider:
Target Audience, why people visit your website?, what are tasks can they achieve, and information they need?, and when they are likely to return?
after studying all considerations, you can organize the information into sections or pages.
so you can now create a diagram of pages (site map) and a wireframe sketch of the key information needed on page.

Visual hierarchy(like size, color, style and so on) is important, like you can highlight what you need audience notice.
