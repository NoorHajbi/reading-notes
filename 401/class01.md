### Primitive Data Types

1. **byte** Default Value Is -> 	0
2. **short** Default Value Is -> 	0
3. **int** Default Value Is -> 	    0
4. **long** Default Value Is -> 	0L
5. **float** Default Value Is -> 	0.0f

### Summary of Variables

- Instance variables (non-static fields) are unique to each instance of a class.
- Class variables (static fields) are fields declared with the static modifier; there is exactly one copy of a class variable, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. 
- Local variables store temporary state inside a method.
- Parameters are variables that provide extra information to a method.
- The java.lang.String class represents character strings.

- When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language). The very short version could be, yes, compile means to make the code executable.
