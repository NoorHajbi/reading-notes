# OO Design

## [SOLID principles intro](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)

- SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).
-  SOLID stands for:  
**S** - Single-responsiblity Principle(SRP)  
**O** - Open-closed Principle(OCP)  
**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle  
**I** - Interface Segregation Principle  
**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle  

```
Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```
```
Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
```
OCB means the class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.

```
Interface segregation principle states:
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
```

```
Dependency inversion principle states:
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
```



## [OO SOLID principles in real life](https://dzone.com/articles/the-solid-principles-in-real-life)

### SOLID

- **S** Single-responsiblity Principle

- **O** Open-closed Principle

People should't change your class later. 

- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle  

LSP says, `that any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing up.`


- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle  


**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
