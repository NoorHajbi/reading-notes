  ***So, Why don't we exercise ourselves in the growth mindset?***  
  *Let's daily before you sleep ask yourself some questions, like these*
  
 

 Keep going. | Keep growing.
----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
*What made you think hard today?  | *Did you work as hard as you could have?
*How will you challenge yourself? | *What are your plans for tomorrow?  

*And now let's try to change every negative idea to positive, i will start with myself*

- [x] I work hard.
- [ ] I'm very smart enough.
- [x] I believe in myself.
- [ ] I am always focused.
