# Readings: NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com  

- **What is node.js?**  
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. 

Is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code, that means  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.

V8 engine features -> a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

- **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**  
Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

- **What is npm?**

- **What version of node are you running on your machine?**  
v12.21.0

- **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
- **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

- **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
Learning from fellow students.

- **How does pair programming work?**  
1. pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
2. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
3. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
