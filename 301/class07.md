## How I explained REST to my brother
 
- **Who is Roy Fielding?**  
helped write the first web servers.
and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.
Roy Fielding name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
- **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**  
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

achines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. 

- **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**  
HTTP like the beginning of what I type into the browser
It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world, like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

- **What does a *GET* do?** 
 GET, return a resource for a human when they type in a web page. 

- **What does a *POST* do?**  
 If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.
- **What does *PUT* do?**  
 If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.
- **What does *PATCH* do?**  
 If a system wants to do a partial update, it'll use PATCH.
